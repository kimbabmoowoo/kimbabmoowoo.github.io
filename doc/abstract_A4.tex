\begin{abstract}
We present an unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) algorithm for simultaneously
estimating attitude and gyroscope bias from an inertial measurement unit
(IMU).  The algorithm is formulated as a discrete-time stochastic nonlinear
filter, with state space given by the direct product matrix Lie group
$\mbox{SO(3)} \times \mathbb{R}^3$, and observations in $\mbox{SO(3)}$
reconstructed from IMU measurements of gravity and the earth's magnetic
field.  Computationally efficient implementations of our filter are made
possible by formulating the state space dynamics and measurement equations
in a way that leads to closed-form equations for covariance propagation
and update.  The resulting attitude estimates are invariant with respect
to choice of fixed and moving reference frames.  The performance advantages
of our filter vis-\`{a}-vis existing state-of-the-art IMU attitude
estimation algorithms are validated via numerical and hardware experiments
involving both synthetic and real data.
